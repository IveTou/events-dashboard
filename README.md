# Events Dashboard - Project Description


## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Clone this repo and execute `yarn`;

## üèÉ Running the app

```bash
yarn dev
```

The application will launch at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Run the tests

```bash
yarn test
```

Watching mode
```bash
yarn test-watch
```

## Architecture/Path Structure

This architecture is build based on Feature-Sliced Design (FSD), Clean Architecture and File type Design.


### Layouts

Especial class directory with comprises in structural component(s) which orchestrate what and how elements appear on screen; defines basic pages look-and-feel.

## Pages

Main content component which is orchestrated by routers and placed on the screen as Layout children. They are enabled to consume context data.

### Components

Building blocks or compositional components which are as mre agnostic as possible, to ease testing and code reuse. Tis components just expose its interfaces to out side and do not know about who is using that.

### Services

Clients or interfaces with outside services as APIs, for example. (in our case just localStorage API)

### Utils

Shared modules.

### Context

Context providers which are responsible for managing data and provide it to pages.

### Enum/Types

Defines data model by types and enums which can be used by the entire project.

### Test

Test configuration files and mocks

## Backlog

- Check semantics and ARIA
- Use API to fetch and post data
- Use State Management Tool if necessary
- Check DRY
- More tests
- Lint (run/dev and push time) for code quality and pattern compliance 
- List pagination and fetch pagination
- (OR) Virtualize list with _react-window_
- Config alias for paths
- More componentzation
- Check Architecture

## React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

### Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
export default {
  // other rules...
  parserOptions: {
    ecmaVersion: 'latest',
    sourceType: 'module',
    project: ['./tsconfig.json', './tsconfig.node.json'],
    tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
  },
}
```

- Replace `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended` to `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked` or `plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked`
- Optionally add `plugin:@typescript-eslint/stylistic-type-checked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and add `plugin:react/recommended` & `plugin:react/jsx-runtime` to the `extends` list
